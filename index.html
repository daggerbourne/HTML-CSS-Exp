        <h2>This Week in 2...</h2>
        <p>...Paragraphs. This week started of with a freak storm, then quickly became one of the prettiest weeks we
            have head
            in a long time, I think Fall is finally here. We had a great time hanging out with friends during a murder
            mystery party, and eventually
            had a great halloween.
        </p>
        <p>One of the things that we really enjoyed was teaching Ezra how halloween works.</p>
